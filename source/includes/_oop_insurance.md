*Available modes of operation: real-time*

The Out-of-Pokit (OOP) Insurance Estimate endpoint takes advantage of industry standard calculation methods
and our eligibility endpoint to provide an estimate of what consumers may expect to pay out of pocket for a set of services.

### Endpoint Description

Available OOP Insurance Endpoints:

<!--- beginning of table -->

| Endpoint                                  | HTTP Method | Description                                                                                     |
|:------------------------------------------|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /oop/insurance-load-price                 | POST        | Loads procedure prices for a specific trading partner                                           |
| /oop/insurance-load-price/{price_uuid}    | DELETE      | Removes a previously loaded procedure price from the system                                     |
| /oop/insurance-estimate                   | POST        | Returns estimated out of pocket cost and eligibility information for a given procedure          |

<!--- end of table -->

The `/oop/insurance-load-price` POST endpoint is used to load pricing data that is used in the `/oop-insurance-estimate` endpoint's calculations.
The `/oop/insurance-load-price` endpoint may also be used to retrieve pricing data, specific to the client that loaded it.
Sending a request that includes only the trading_partner_id and cpt_bundle parameters will either return the currently loaded price or, if no price has been loaded, return an error response.


### `/oop/insurance-load-price`

The `/oop/insurance-load-price` POST endpoint accepts the following parameters:

<!--- beginning of table -->

| Parameter          | Type     | Description                                                                                   | Presence |
|:-------------------|:---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------|
| trading_partner_id | {string} | Unique id for the intended trading partner, as specified by the Trading Partners endpoint.    | Required |
| cpt_bundle         | {array}  | Collection of {string} CPT codes which would be billed as a bundle with a single price        | Required |
| price.amount       | {string} | The price of the bundle of procedures in the cpt_bundle                                       | Optional (include to load price, do not include to retrieve price) |
| price.currency     | {string} | Optional: The denomination of the currency of the price.amount. Defaults to 'USD'             | Optional (include to load price, do not include to retrieve price) |

<!--- end of table -->

The `/oop/insurance-load-price` POST response contains the aforementioned fields and activity tracking meta data.
The `/oop/insurance-load-price` POST response also contains a "uuid" field that can be passed to the `/oop/insurance-load-price/{price_uuid}` DELETE endpoint as the {price_uuid} in order to remove that loaded pricing data.
The `/oop/insurance-load-price/{price_uuid}` DELETE endpoint may be used to delete previously loaded pricing data.

### `/oop/insurance-estimate`
Customer-specific procedure prices must be first loaded into the PokitDok platform by calling the Insurance Price Load API endpoint (`/oop/insurance-load-price POST`). 
The Insurance Estimate API endpoint (`/oop/insurance-estimate POST`) may then be called to request an estimate. The following describes how the estimate is calculated. 

When the Insurance Estimate API endpoint is called, an eligibility request is made, allowing Pokitdok to retrieve the patient's deductible, max out of pocket, and coinsurance information.
This data is then used to generate an estimate of what the patient can expect to pay out of pocket. Sometimes the coinsurance information provided in the eligibility response contains multiple coinsurances; 
in these cases our Insurance Estimate API will filter the coinsurance options and use them to generate and return multiple estimates according to the following:

* Coinsurances that are in network ( “in_plan_network” : “yes” ) pass through the filter.

* If no coinsurances are in network ( “in_plan_network” : “no” ), then coinsurances where network is not applicable ( “in_plan_network” : “not_applicable” ) pass through the filter.

* If service type codes are passed in, only coinsurances that have the same set of service type codes pass through the filter.

The following logic is then applied for each filtered coinsurance to calculate estimates: 

* If the deductible is greater than or equal to the customer-specific procedure price, then the estimate is returned as the procedure price.

* If the deductible is less than the procedure price and a coinsurance is specified, the price after coinsurance is then calculated as (procedure price - deductible) *x* coinsurance.
    * If the (deductible + price after coinsurance) is less than the max out of pocket, then the estimate is returned as the (deductible + price after coinsurance)
    * If (deductible + price after coinsurance) is greater than the max out of pocket, then the estimate is returned as the max out of pocket.

* If coinsurance is not specified,

If eligibility information is not provided, generated eligibility data will be used, and a less accurate out of pocket estimate may be generated.

If either `eligibility.member` or `eligibility.provider` data is omitted, 
generic eligibility data will be used, and the generated out 
of pocket estimate will be less accurate. However, by including both 
`eligibility.member` and `eligibility.provider` data on your request you 
enable the Pokitdok API to perform a real-time eligibility check for the 
patient. Always include both fields whenever possible to ensure your 
customers receive the best possible estimate of out of pocket costs.

While the endpoint accepts a five-digit zip code, only the first three digits
are significant. This is because the index is only granular to the first three
digits of the zip code, commonly called a "geozip" or a "ZIP Code Prefix". These
three digits refer to the geographical regions surrounding major cities or
metropolitan areas. There are approximately 900 "geozips" in the United States.
